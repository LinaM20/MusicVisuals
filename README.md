# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Lina Mir

Student Number: C19366191

# Description of the assignment
This assignment required me to create "something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music." I created a visual art peice that repsonds to the amplitude of the music by creating a music visualiser using processing in java. My assignment uses both 2D and 3D shapes.



# Instructions
- To start the music, press the space key. This starts the music off and the visuals begin reacting. 
- Next press either 1, 2 or 3 to see different visuals, colours and shapes respond to the music.
- If you press key 1, you should see a sphere.
- Press key 2 to 
- Pressing key 3 will produce a cube with a waveform in the middle. The waveform reacts to the music and different parts of the waveform move.

# How it works
I created a few branches to work on different things and then when I was satisfied I merged the work from the branches onto the master branch.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
